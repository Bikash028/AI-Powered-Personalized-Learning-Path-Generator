# AI-Powered-Personalized-Learning-Path-Generator-Using-Machine-Learning


An AI-powered full-stack web application that analyzes student performance using Machine Learning and generates adaptive weekly learning plans with progress tracking.

📌 Project Overview

This system analyzes multi-dimensional student performance data (score, time taken, attempts, improvement trend) and:

Detects weak and strong topics using ML

Generates personalized weekly learning plans

Recommends resources

Tracks improvement over time

Visualizes performance using interactive charts

This project demonstrates how AI can be applied to educational analytics and adaptive learning systems.
